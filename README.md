# Python-Object-Oriented-Programming-Assignment

This repository contains solutions to the Object-Oriented Programming assignment.  
It covers **class design, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** in Python.

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

- Created a **MusicalInstrument** base class with attributes and methods.  
- Used **encapsulation** (`__brand`) with a getter method.  
- Added **inheritance**:
  - `Guitar` (with number of strings)  
  - `Piano` (with number of keys)  
- Demonstrated **polymorphism** by overriding the `play()` method differently in each subclass.

## Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge

- Created a base class **Vehicle** with a `move()` method.  
- Subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`, `Bicycle`) override `move()` differently.  
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** in action.
